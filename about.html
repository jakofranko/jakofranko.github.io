<div class="center-vertical">
    <p>I am, among many other things, a full-stack developer and UI/UX designer. My areas of expertise are C-based languages (JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Java, C#), Lisps (mainly Clojure right now), Databases (SQL, MongoDB), and the front-end stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).</p>

    <p>I'm currently employed on a team of developers that build the tools used to build and maintain the front-pages of a large financial institution. In the past, I have worked to build and design web-sites for a number of clients as a freelance developer, and also worked on a team that built and maintained an enterprise-level internal tools suite on a LAMP application that used a custom MVC framework of our our design.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I like to build games, Twitter bots, and efficiency tools, and almost all of my projects are on GitHub.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to get in touch with me for any reason whatsoever, don't hesitate to shoot me a message on Twitter.</p>
