<p>I am, among many other things, a full-stack developer and UI/UX designer. My areas of expertise are C-based languages (JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Java, C#), Lisps (mainly Clojure right now), Databases (SQL, MongoDB), and the front-end stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Most of my work these days uses React for the client-side applications.</p>

<p>I'm currently on a team of developers that build the tools used to build and maintain the front-pages and SEO for a large financial institution. Our tools are built using our own modular React framework, <a href="https://github.com/americanexpress/one-app">which has been open-sourced</a> In the past, I have worked to build and design web-sites for a number of clients as a freelance developer, and also worked on a team that built and maintained an enterprise-level internal tools suite on a LAMP application that used a custom MVC framework of our own design.</p>

<p>In my free time, I like to build games, Twitter bots, and efficiency tools, and almost all of my projects are on GitHub. Please <a href="/work">check out my work</a></p>

<p>If you'd like to get in touch with me for any reason whatsoever, don't hesitate to shoot me a message on <a href="https://twitter.com/rockfacejake">Twitter</a>.
