I am, among many other things, a full-stack developer and UI/UX designer. My areas of expertise are most C-based languages (JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Java, C#), Lisps (mainly Clojure right now), Databases (SQL, MongoDB), and the front-end stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I'm currently employed on a team of developers that maintain an enterprise-level internal tools suite on a LAMP application platform on top of a custom MVC platform. In my free time, I like to build games, Twitter bots, and efficiency tools, and almost all of my projects are on GitHub.

If you'd like to get in touch with me for any reason whatsoever, don't hesitate to shoot me a message on Twitter.
